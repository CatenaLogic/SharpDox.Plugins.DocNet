# SharpDox.Plugins.DocNet
DocNet plugin for SharpDox


## Usage

Very limited guide for now:

1. Build this DocNet plugin
2. Build the latest SharpDox
3. Create a single sdox like this one: https://github.com/Catel/Catel/blob/develop/src/Catel.sdox
4. Generate the files

See https://github.com/Catel/Catel.Docs/tree/master/src/vnext/reference for an example of the generated docs. Combined with DocNet, this results in nice documentation as shown at http://docs.catelproject.com/vnext/reference/
